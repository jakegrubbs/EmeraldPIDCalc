Tool for finding shiny frames with corruption type 7 in Pok√©mon Emerald

Welcome! This is a tool I created because I got tired of converting hexadecimal numbers 
(and doing other calculations) manually. It adds a few features to make hunting for your 
shiny frame easier. This is a work in progress, and I do not consider it a stable 
release at this point.

If you don't know what any of this means, check out some of these resources
(I do not take credit for any of these; they are not my creations):
